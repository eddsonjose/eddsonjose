            Nature in its finest and largest form acts as the subject matter for my art. I use digital mediums to bring nature to a state of simplistic beauty by incorporating visual techniques such as low polygon count on 3D models, a gracious amount of negative space, and ambient music that plays to the references of the objects in its shared space. My process includes the use of low-poly 3D models to represent my subject matter in its most rudimentary yet most efficient way of presenting itself in a digital space. Within the space of my art is a gracious amount of negative space to offer the viewer a serene space in which to contemplate the subject matter. Additionally, ambient music serves not only to compliment the subject matter but to add to the perception the intricate and often hidden entities that make nature whole. In my recent projects, Iâ€™ve incorporated the mentioned techniques to present art that depicts a binary star and its formation into a Type 1A supernova. Low-poly models were used to create the stars depicted in the visual and the music depicts the three stages that form the supernova using contrasts in volume and complexity.

            A general notion for my art exists at the boundary between the terms natural and artificial. Like the life forms we see in everyday life (e.g. a tree or bird), these life forms evolved to become efficient in gathering necessary resources; a tree growing tall and wide to gather large swathes of sunlight or a bird evolving larger wings to minimize flapping and maximize air time while conserving energy to increase hunting time. A low poly model presents itself in its most minimal form to load or render itself within a scene efficiently, quickly, and with the least amount of data. Making use of our auditory senses we are able to gather more information of our surroundings and paired with visual information we can create more memorable experiences. Audio inherently gives a sense of atmosphere, mood, and life thus offering an efficient way of creating a memorable experience. My practice seeks to present the inclination of natural objects to evolve towards efficiency given their environment by presenting an artificial representation of natural objects in their most efficient forms within a digital environment. In this simple form my art acts to give beauty to an otherwise mundane recreation and surround my subject matter with enough sensory experiences to efficiently create a lasting impression.
