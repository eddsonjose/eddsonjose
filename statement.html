        <h1>My art practice explores the infinite possibilities of using new media while incorporating my skills with traditional ones. I seek to visualize my interpretation of global conundrums and goals that humankind would like to achieve by placing viewers inside virtual environments or through. My work involves the elements of the universe, its forces and bodies, as well as the natural and unnatural elements on Earth emphasizing balance and longevity for Earthâ€™s inhabitants by means of interaction. Influenced by issues such as pollution, infrastructure over nature, and the recent boom in space exploration, my goal is to bring light to such topics while maintaining a positive outlook for the future.<br>My recent works include digital art made through code in combination with digital painting and modeling programs. Artificial is Natural questions the idea of what truly is considered natural if all things in the universe are made of the same material. I implemented my skills in Javascript while honing my skills in HTML and CSS to give the viewer a new form of expression. My work seeks to create digital art that interacts with the user to create an immersive and critically engaging experience.
