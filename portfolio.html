          <div class="text">Better Alone? is a project about social anxiety in the presence of an unknown character in a crowded train station. The project explores the anxiety one might feel being in large crowds of people while seeking comfort by alienating themselves. The character must traverse the crowd only to find herself missing the crowded train towards home. She finds comfort as she waits alone for the last train that is often empty. She sleeps through the night and has a nightmare of the people she may encounter the next day. Nightmare becomes reality and the cycle continues. Is it better to be alone in a world that is otherwise full of people?<br><br>2019, Dimensions: 1920p x 1080p, Medium: Video

          <div class="text">Against the Current is a game about social anxiety. The player must traverse a never ending crowd of people. The player can choose to move forward (against the crowd) while increasing their feelings of nervousness or the player can choose to interact with people to decrease their nervous feelings and increase their confidence.The player moves through the crowd easier/faster if they are confident. If the player is nervous they move slower through the crowd. The player will also engage in a situation that places the player against themself, forcing the player in a standstill thus preventing any progress. It is a person's own judgement and willingness to move against their anxiety in order to make it better. Towards the end, nothing can be completely forgotten thus the player's controls remain the same but move in the opposite direction. The game concludes the same way it began - this time moving with the current.<br>2019, Dimensions: 1500p x 500p, Medium: HTML Game

          <div class="text">What humans perceive as artificial is truly natural in a universal outlook because everything in the universe is made up of the same material â€“ stardust. The human body, the mind, and its creations are a product of nature. What is unnatural is simply another name for man-made. Constellations are a human construct that we view as an object to believe in. Drawing with the stars will help change the scale of our perception of nature into the scale of the universe. Gender is another construct of humanity. Many say that there is naturally only two genders and anything more is considered unnatural. I say let there be a thousand genders because what makes a gender is what makes a human and what makes a human is nature. Let us believe what we want, let us form the stars into shapes, and let us be who we desire to be. Your drawing is what you believe in and your belief is natural.<br><br>2019, Dimensions: n/a, Medium: Digital (Website Drawing Machine)
