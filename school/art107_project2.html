      <h1>Artificial Earth</h1>
      <h2>Eddson Jose</h2>
      <p>The effect of the creation of industrial and modern artifacts contribute greatly to the environmental damage done on Earth. As the global temperature rises so to do artificially induced natural disasters. Wildfires are one of the many natural disasters increasing in abundance. Artificial Earth visualizes wildfires by overlaying fire on top of a landscape.<br><br> Earth's revolution shows the passing of time while its distance between the viewer suggests hierarchical proportion (a subject's importance relative to scale). As Earth moves back and forth in the importance of the viewer's mind so too do the fires increase inversely relative to Earth's proportion.</p><br><br>
