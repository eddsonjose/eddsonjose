        <i>Universally Natural</i> is a series containing three artworks depicting the relationship between natural and artificial objects. <i>Universally Natural</i> promotes the idea that everything within the universe is natural by visualizing artificial objects as natural ones. Like all things on Earth, everything in the universe is derived from the same elements. As the journal <i>We Are Made of Starstuff</i>¹ suggests, stars, planets, humans, nature, and artifacts are all, when broken down, a combination of atoms.
        <br><br>
        Using a combination of tools such as Blender, After Effects, Photoshop, and A-Frame the project is able to embody the artificial half of the project. In accordance with the intention to create a natural object, the project then becomes whole. The result of the two halves of the project is an artificial recreation of natural objects; objects that are derived from a combination of natural interactions. A natural interaction in the context of a digital environment is the physical interactions that result in digital imagery. An example, a typical monitor is made up of pixels. Pixels are a set of red, green, and blue liquid crystals. Electricity is run through the crystals in varying light intensities forming a certain color. In combination with the input from the user of a computer and the electrical signals in our neurons that fire to form thoughts, <i>Universally Natural</i> is simply a series of natural interactions where every interaction is physical.
        <br><br>
        A physical object, whether it is naturally made or man made, is natural. Trees and mountains are formed by “nature.” Nature is the result of Earth’s natural interactions: tectonic plates shifting to form mountains, the movement of rivers to slowly erode and form a canyon, water seeping into the roots of a sapling to grow a tall tree. Animals live off of the resources brought upon by Earth. Animals create homes made of twigs, leaves, and dirt. Humans also live off of the resources brought upon by Earth. The things we make are all derived from Earth albeit our creations are more complex, intricate, larger, or smaller. Our steel offices, concrete roads, rare metal filled smartphones, and everything artificial is derived and assembled here on Earth. It is only natural that the animals living on Earth use its resources therefore it is natural that artificial objects exist.
        <br><br>
        <i>Artificial is Natural</i> visualizes the distinction we give to the terms artificial and natural. In the photographic series titled <i>Off Season</i>² by Fabien Fourcaud, environments with a mix of man made structures and nature are showcased without human presence apart from the presence of the viewer. In <i>Off Season</i>, artificial and natural are two distinct entities yet live in unity on the same plane; that being the earth and the photograph itself. <i>Artificial is Natural</i> incorporates the same technique as Fourcaud where artificial and nature exist within the same virtual environment distinguished by their opposing locations.
        <br><br>
        <i>Artificial Earth</i> takes into account the natural disasters induced by humans and its creations. <i>The Ecological Impacts of Climate Change</i>³ along with the visuals presented in <i>Human Impacts on the Environment</i>⁴ details the impact humanity has had on Earth, climate change, and natural disasters. <i>The Artificial and the Natural: An Evolving Polarity</i>⁵ investigates art in reference to nature and the artificial; in this reading art is directly tied to the term artificial. As is with all the artworks in <i>Universally Natural</i>, art would seemingly distinguish itself apart from what <i>Universally Natural</i> tries to depict - nature. However, <i>Universally Natural</i> seeks to depict that art/artificial and nature are one in the same.
        <br><br>
        <i>Blanket Term: Natural</i> embodies the idea that all things are natural. Taking ideas from the previous two projects, nature and the artificial are shown as separate materials that glitch within the forms the materials are given to show the impact of human creations to depict nature.<br><br>- Eddson Jose
